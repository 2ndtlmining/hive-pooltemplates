*   **DON'T UPGRADE TO THIS VERSION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE EARLY ADOPTER AND YOUR FARM UPTIME IS CRITICAL.**
This is a very big update with many changes. It was tested but usually there are hotfixes with such things.
*   Totally redesigned packages architecture. Now Hive Core and miners are in separate packages.
Updates are much quicker and traffic wise. Only required miners and updated. 
Miners are autoinstalled if you use them. 
You can have different miners versions installed without downgrading.
*   Version now consists of Hive Core version and repository update date. Like `0.6-01@181121`.  
So miners packages can be released without changing Hive Core version. 
Hive Core itself is the thing that contains all the scripts which control system boot, overclocking, watchdogs, etc. But not the miners. 
*   `hpkg` console utility to manually control Hive packages, uninstall, update, list, etc. Run it to see usage instructions.
*   Most of custom miners are in main branch now. Please update you Flight Sheets.

*   optiminer deprecated and removed
*   ccminer-update deprecated, all miners are included now
*   CUDA 9.2 is now default for most miners. Nvidia driver >=396 is required. 
It is advised to use `nvidia-driver-update` on old installations. Or reflash Hive image.
Optionally you can select CUDA 9.1 or lower versions of miners if available.    
*   custom-get - no needed for `-f` for update, just change URL in FS
*   Updated version in `/hive/opt/e1000e/e1000e-upgrade.sh` to update Intel LAN driver 
*   One more HW watchdog on the same QinHeng HL-340 chip. 
`/hive/opt/qinheng/wd-fixorgua` to enable this type of WD.

##### 0.5-19 2018-01-09

*   "Overclocking Profile" required changes so that is can be applied from the web. This is a required update if you want to use this feature.
*   Tweaked filesystem mount options in /etc/fstab so that USB flash drives will work longer (noatime,commit=120)
*   Much quicker Nvidia OC applying on the rig

##### 0.5-18 2018-01-03

*   Nvidia P104-100 support
*   dstm 0.5.8

##### 0.5-17 2017-12-28

*   Added "vm.nr_hugepages=128" and "* hard memlock 262144" "* soft memlock 262144" to fix "MEMORY ALLOC FAILED: mlock failed" in xmr-stack-cpu
*   OpenDev Watchdogs ids updated for new Pro devices, added "0483:a26d"
*   Esonics Watchdogs support added
*   Added "--report-hashrate" as a default ethminer option in config
*   Minor fixes with GPU order after restart. False "Selfupgrade successful" message on fail.

##### 0.5-16 2017-12-25

*   Miner start problem after reboot seems to be resolved. The issue is related to slow flash drives.
*   xorg.conf for Nvidia is generated more wisely now. If you had GPUs with pci ids like 3c:00:0. 8b:00:0 (etc.) this will help you.
*   ccminer Gh/s bug fix improved. Some GPUs do not have idle load at 0%, but 3-4% of load. Now this is also detected.

##### 0.5-14 2017-12-22

*   dstm 0.5.7
*   Claymore CryptoNote 11.0
*   ccminer Gh/s bug prevented. Ccminer fails and begin to report giga hashes though it's not mining. Now hive agent inspects GPU load % and if it's 0 then it does not believe ccminer anymore and sets hashrate to 0.
*   WiFi online status is checked with other service now, so no more delays at startup. Also that could cause not working WiFi after reboot, please check again if you had problems before. And this relates to systems with multiple network interfaces.
*   Added AMD OC Mem State selection, some GPUs found to require this to undervolt
*   AMD bios downloads have pretty names now like "vbios-0-RadeonRX470-4G--113-1E3471U_O69.rom"
*   Added force option to AMD bios flashing

##### 0.5-12 2017-12-11

*   AMD undervolting now works from panel! Please set core voltage like 900 with DMP desired level.
*   Added `127.0.0.1 cryptonight.usa.nicehash.com` and `127.0.0.1 daggerhashimoto.usa.nicehash.com` to /etc/hosts because Claymore DevFee could not miner there and crashed
*   ccminer recompiled for event more CPU platforms like old AMD Phenom II
*   ccminer could show hashrate even when GPU was hang, now stats detect this by zero temp on that card
*   `amd-info` more convenient way to show AMD clocks
*   `rocm-smi` more another utility for AMD clocks
*   Turn Off LEDs on Nvidias from OC dialog. May not work on some cards.
*   Latest drivers amdgpu-pro-17.40-492261 and NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-387.34. DOES NOT AUTOUPDATE, ONLY WITH NEW IMAGE
*   Custom compiled Linux Kernel. DOES NOT AUTOUPDATE, ONLY WITH NEW IMAGE
*   Claymore reboot did not actually happen on hang, fixed

##### 0.5-10 2017-12-06

##### 0.5-09 2017-12-05

*   Rolling back to Claymore Dual 10.1, as the 10.2 has many complaints
*   On some systems miner started before Nvidia OC applied

*   Added big Nicehash wallet example
*   Other minor fixes

##### 0.5-05 2017-11-05

*   dstm 0.5.4, gpu ordering fixes, fixed hashrate report on pool disconnect (?)
*   AMD OC applied in wrong order for 10+ cards
*   Reboot and Shutdown commands improved
*   Readonly claymore's management port, so no more hacking

##### 0.5-04 2017-10-30

*   Fixed Claymore reboot, agent was killed and rig went offline, reboot did not happen
*   Fixed Nvidia GPU order right after reboot
*   Log truncate did not work
*   Claymore config generator will set DCRI to 0 if no DCOIN set, this will add some Mh on AMD cards

*   Claymore 10.1, dstm 0.5.3
*   Fixed bug with non starting miner, overwriting config update upgrade
*   Added EWBF custom settings field
*   Changed behavior on naming rigs. If you had rig named with only numbers like "1", then the WORKER_NAME was prefixed with "hive1". It was confusing so this is not true anymore, it will stay "1".

##### LINUX IMAGE RELEASE 0.5-01 2017-10-27

*   Second miner. You can launch 2 miners at the same time. Maybe you will want CPU miner or separate miners for AMD and Nvidia cards.
*   New miners: ethminer, sgminer-gm, dstm, xmr-stak-cpu.
*   AMD driver 17.40 with DAG fix, OC+downvolt still do not work together. ROCm kernel removed to save space.
*   Nvidia GPU order is now the same as PCI bus id, so order in miner and rig admin is the same now, much easier to overclock
*   Internal GPU detection, now you can use monitor on internal GPU with Nvidias
*   miner will start only after Nvidia OC will be applied
*   miners rotates 5 logs now between restarts so you can examine previous runs
*   Trying to handle nvidia-smi hangs, maybe a reason for agent stop
*   Hive FAT partition will be visible in Windows, some versions had problems
*   Static IP and WiFI config files can be edited from Windows now
*   `sreboot shutdown` ‚Äì more aggressive shutdown command
*   `watchdog-opendev reset|power` ‚Äì to send command to OpenDev watchdogs
*   `miner log` with color as it is on a real screen now seen on the web

##### LINUX IMAGE RELEASE 0.4-20 2017-10-14

*   Nvidia default power limit is restored after setting back to 0 in OC settings
*   /hive-config/http_proxy.txt to set HTTP PROXY, you can edit file from Windows

##### 0.4-17 2017-10-12

*   Hashrate Watchdog. You can set minimal hashrate for each miner in "Tuning". If it drops below minimal then there will be attempt to restart miner. If miner restart does not help, then reboot will be done.
*   ewbf "API bind error" solved, no more "Miner Offline" after restart


##### LINUX IMAGE RELEASE 0.4-13 2017-10-07

*   DAG fix for AMD. New image has dual boot now, kernel 4.10 by default (without fix) and ROCm patched kernel 4.11 (with DAG fix). The down side of fix is that when you set Core or Mem clock then downvolting will NOT work. Though you can flash VBIOS with proper frequencies and set DPM downvolting states from the web.
*   Downgraded AMD drivers to 16.60 for DPM (downvolting) to work.
*   Changed AMD OC power management. Removed Voltage Index and added DPM Core States for downvolting.
*   Added "Tuning" button in rig profile. Now you can override any individual setting from the wallet.
*   Added miner "restart", "last log" and "show config" buttons
*   Motherboard model and kernel version in the rig profile now
*   WiFi setup script, just run `wifi` to try
*   Force reboot script, helps a lot with hanging GPUs where standard reboot does not work, run `sreboot` to try
*   Fixed GPU stats order for mixed setups
*   /hive-config is now on FAT partition, you can set ID and pass from your ugly Windows)
*   VNC password is stored in /hive-config/vnc-password.txt now. And you can disable VNC.
*   Added `pci=noaer iommu=soft` options to grub bootloader, no more flooding errors on the screen. IOMMU motherboards (like GA-970A-DS3P) will work from the box.
